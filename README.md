# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the selling price of a used car based on its features like year, kms driven, fuel type, etc. It was built as part of my internship at **InternPe**.

## 🔍 Features
- End-to-end pipeline using `scikit-learn`
- Preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer` & `OneHotEncoder`
- Trained using Linear Regression
- Accepts **live user input** via console (no web UI)
- Model exported using `pickle`

- Year: 2015
Present Price: 5.6
KMs Driven: 32000
Owner: 0
Fuel Type: Petrol
Seller Type: Dealer
Transmission: Manual

Estimated Price of the Car: ₹ 3.21 Lakhs

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Building ML pipelines

Handling categorical + numeric features

Model serialization with pickle

Taking dynamic input from users

Real-world data cleaning & EDA
